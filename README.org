This repository is part of the [[https://www.evo-land.eu/][EVOLAND Horizon Europe]] project.
It provides a User Defined Function to extract Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 satellite image time series embeddings with MALICE model.
The input time series can have any length, although it is not recommended to overcome 18 months. The output embeddings have fixed size of 10 x 64 x H x W

The respository include the [[file:src/openeo_malice/udf.py][User Defined Function]] implemented using a ONNX export of the best model, as well as a [[file:src/openeo_superresolution/run.py][runtime script]] allowing to use it with your OpenEO account.
