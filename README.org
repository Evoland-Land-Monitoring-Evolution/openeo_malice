This repository is part of the [[https://www.evo-land.eu/][EVOLAND Horizon Europe]] project.
It provides a User Defined Function to extract Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 satellite image time series embeddings with MALICE model.
The input time series can have any temporal length, although the recommended length is between 6 and 18 months.
The output embeddings have fixed size of (10 x 64) x H x W.

MALICEâ€™s encoder architecture is a multi-temporal multi-modal network based on ALISE mono-modal architecture [2].
MaALICE is a two-branch neural network where each branch processes a single modality by using spatial, spectral and temporal encoder (SSTE),
which corresponds to the proposed U-BARN architecture [1], and a temporal projector.
The temporal projector produces aligned representations thanks to a cross-attention mechanism with learnable queries.
Although the SSTE weights differ for each modality, a common temporal projector is shared between both branches. Hence, we consider that the two modalities
are aligned on the same latent temporal features. The modality-specific encoders
are denoted by ALISE^{S2} and ALISE^{S1}.

The respository include the [[file:src/openeo_malice/udf.py][User Defined Function]] for Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 time series embeddings extraction
implemented using a ONNX export of the best model, as well as a [[file:src/openeo_malice/run.py][runtime script]] allowing to use it with your OpenEO account.
